<body>
    
   
    
    <p>
        let me start sharing my thoughts to sense the highly  used term <strong> “ Love ”</strong> by means of asking a most  famous question what is love ? and how can you share your love towards your loved one.
        <br>
        <br>
        As we get huge number of answers from different kinds of people . some one says it was an affection between two people especially between opposite gender . some people say it is a inner feeling,positive emotion ,some one say it is a bridge to connect two person ,some say  it is a deep affection towards our loved ones. Some people said love is a good habit. According to those answers the love can be any where love can be inside as well as outside it can be transmitted as will as received . 
        <br>
        <br>
        Let me explain the real knowledge of love and The best way to experience the love and to sense the real form of love from roots  of Indian mythology and the life of Radha krishna .
        initially love never ever has any kind of gender bias or any kind of discrimination. Love is not about giving wealthy materialistic things. Love is not a physically connecting element .Love is not travelling or leaving together ,love is not fulfilling their needs and love is not a attraction .
        <br>
        <br>
       <h3 style="color: black;background-color:powderblue ;"> 1)LOVE is devotional thing that you always include your loved one in front of your prayer.</h3>
        <ul>parents always make a wish to God behalf for  their children. 
            A wife always treat her husband as a God .
            every children’s mother and father are the  first foremost superior goods to love, respect and obey.
            Children pray to god selflessly with out any kind of intention because of only love .
        </ul>
        
        <h3 style="color: black;background-color:powderblue ;">2)LOVE is independent of time and journey of enlightment</h3>> 
        In love there is no need to spend the long time with our loved one,  there is no need of sharing our rest of the life too, there is no need of hoping or  worrying about the together journey.
        <br>
        I say
        <br> 
        I was not your past 
        <br>
        I am not with you in present  
        <br>
        I may not be in your feature
        <br>
        But if I love you I will definitely be in your knowledge of self realisation and understanding the true world .
        <br>
        I am still happy if our paths and journeys are different ,may be physically we are not connected with all grace of  your enlightment we are always connected in the trance and always leave in my subconscious.
        Because your enlightment is my  happiness ,that was the only as assurance to I can feel that you was really happy since you  had the realistic knowledge of self and the society as well
        <br>
        I am   really Greatful and happy in my love If you are  really efficient to  face the unrealistic world with the complete knowledge 
        <br>
        If you  able to understand and overcome the inner emotions & inner struggles
        If you really able to handle every hard situation that you face in society
        If you are  able to overcome the society is false believes 
        If you are  able to habitat in every new place and with every  new person in feature
        <br>
        The real form of Love is to enlight  our loved ones with knowledge but not actually leaving together  or giving material gifts  since we always be in our loved ones  journey in the form of knowledge we give  
        
        <ul>A Father and Brother may be with her   daughter in past and present but not in the feature . but they always  alive with her daughter in the form of knowledge that helps her daughter to leave  better
            This is the real form of love you give to your loved ones selflessly</ul>
                   <strong> { _SERVE THE LOVE IN THE FORM OF knowledge_ }</strong> 
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Rather then taking or giving  the unrealistic things lets  accept the knowldege & given the knowledge  then the feature will be more bright with fulfilment of all  happy things  then whole society will be fulfilled with all the real  values and affection with out any kind of  obstacles in life . Thats the power & meaning of sharing real love .
        
       <h3 style="color: black;background-color:powderblue ;"> 3)Love is alive in the absence of our loved one:</h3>
       <ul> Your friend always defend your name if some one mistaken you .
        After our parents and teacher our friend are the only persons who have blind trust on our talent </ul>
        <br>
        
        Rather then lover ,boy friend or girl friend let say mother , father, brother , friend,  brotherhood friend, teacher, well wisher ,and more 
        <br>
        
        Lets sense the real meaning and culture of love and lets overcome the false beliefs in the social media ,be like a honey bee that collects only nector where ever it goes and nothing else.
        May be my thoughts and the message is bit lengthy but in real they are realistic facts that I know. And I hope you like it and I am greatful even any one line is enlighten you 
        <br>
        My thought ,my words ,my messages, my knowledge, my kindness ,my service all in the grace of lord <strong>Radha krishna</strong>> ….
